# baubBOARD - a minimalist IO board for the RPi CM4

Contains only 5v input and ethernet port

Will eventually stack to enable super DENSE compute clusters

Will probably need some beefy cooling.

Ultimate COMPUTE

TODO:

- Should probably add reverse voltage/polyfuse protection
- Make >smaller<
- How to reduce stack height? Or are we limited by the thickness of ethernet port
  - Could Make 2 offset PCBs to stagger ethernet ports
  - Use custom port?
